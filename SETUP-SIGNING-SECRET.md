# üîê CRITICAL: Bot Protection Setup Required

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Your Order System Will NOT Work Until You Complete This Setup

I've added HMAC signature-based bot protection to prevent fake orders and promo code abuse. However, you MUST configure a signing secret for it to work.

## Step 1: Generate a Secure Secret

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

This will output something like:
```
dK8mP3nR7qT9wX2yC5bN8hV4jF6gL1mS9pQ3rT8uY2zA5cD7e
```

Copy this value - you'll need it for both steps below.

## Step 2: Set Secret in Netlify

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com/
2. Select your EVOQ site
3. Go to **Site configuration** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
4. Click **Add a variable**
5. Add:
   - **Key:** `VITE_SIGNING_SECRET`
   - **Value:** (paste your generated secret from Step 1)
   - **Scopes:** Check both "Builds" and "Functions"
6. Click **Save**
7. **Important:** Redeploy your site for changes to take effect

## Step 3: Set Secret in Supabase

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your EVOQ project
3. Go to **Edge Functions** (in the sidebar)
4. Click **Manage secrets** or **Add secret**
5. Add:
   - **Name:** `SIGNING_SECRET` (no VITE_ prefix!)
   - **Value:** (paste the SAME secret from Step 1)
6. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Update Local .env (Optional - for local testing)

If you want to test locally:

1. Open `.env` file in your project root
2. Find the line: `VITE_SIGNING_SECRET=CHANGE_THIS_TO_A_SECURE_RANDOM_STRING_32_CHARS_MIN`
3. Replace with: `VITE_SIGNING_SECRET=your_secret_here`
4. Save the file

**Important:** Never commit the real secret to git!

## How It Works

**Before (Insecure):**
- Anyone could spam orders directly to your API
- Bots could abuse promo codes unlimited times
- No rate limiting or protection

**After (Secure):**
- Every order request is cryptographically signed with HMAC-SHA256
- Server verifies signature matches expected value
- Timestamps prevent replay attacks (5-minute window)
- Rate limiting: max 3 orders per minute per email
- Invalid signatures = instant rejection (403 Forbidden)

## Testing After Setup

1. Go to your shop page
2. Add items to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Fill out the form
5. Submit order

**If configured correctly:**
- Order will process normally
- You'll see "Order saved to database" in console

**If NOT configured:**
- Order will fail with "Invalid request signature"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify secrets are set in BOTH Netlify and Supabase

## What I've Already Done

‚úÖ Removed all admin pages and functionality
‚úÖ Removed all hardcoded Supabase credentials
‚úÖ Added HMAC signature generation in checkout
‚úÖ Added signature verification in edge function
‚úÖ Added rate limiting (client + server side)
‚úÖ Added timestamp validation to prevent replay attacks
‚úÖ Deployed updated create-order edge function

## Security Features Now Active

1. **HMAC Request Signing:** Every order must have valid cryptographic signature
2. **Timestamp Validation:** Rejects requests older than 5 minutes or in the future
3. **Rate Limiting:** Max 3 order attempts per minute per email
4. **No Exposed Admin:** Admin functionality completely removed
5. **Environment Variables:** All credentials loaded from env vars, not hardcoded

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid request signature" error
- Check that signing secret is set in BOTH Netlify and Supabase
- Verify the secret is EXACTLY the same in both places
- In Netlify use: `VITE_SIGNING_SECRET`
- In Supabase use: `SIGNING_SECRET` (no VITE_ prefix)

### Orders still fail after setup
- Clear your browser cache and localStorage
- Redeploy your Netlify site
- Check Supabase edge function logs for errors
- Verify environment variables are in "Production" scope in Netlify

### Want to test locally?
- Set `VITE_SIGNING_SECRET` in your `.env` file
- Restart your dev server (`npm run dev`)
- Never commit `.env` with the real secret

## Need Help?

Check the Netlify deploy logs and Supabase edge function logs for detailed error messages. The signing system will log exactly what's wrong if verification fails.
