## ‚úÖ Issue 2: Mobile Hamburger Menu - COMPLETELY REVAMPED
**Problem:** Hamburger menu displayed but was completely non-functional. Links were unclickable.

**Solution - Complete Mobile Menu Rewrite:**
- Removed problematic passive touch event listeners
- Simplified click handling to work on all devices
- Added proper pointer-events and cursor styles
- Added visual tap feedback with webkit-tap-highlight
- Implemented proper open/close state management
- Added console logging for debugging
- Fixed body scroll prevention

**Key Changes:**
```javascript
// Old: Used conflicting touchstart/touchend with passive listeners
// New: Simple click-based approach that works everywhere
menuToggle.addEventListener('click', toggleMenu);
navLinks.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(link => {
  link.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    console.log('Link clicked:', link.href);
    closeMenu();
  });
});
```

**CSS Improvements:**
- Added `pointer-events: auto` to nav links
- Added `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` for mobile feedback
- Added `:active` state for touch feedback
- Improved z-index layering

**Files Modified:**
- `script.js` (lines 704-778) - Complete rewrite of initMobileMenu()
- `styles.css` (lines 820-841) - Enhanced mobile link styles

## ‚úÖ Issue 4: Checkout Shipping Calculation - FIXED
**Problem:** Checkout showed $10 shipping even with empty cart.

**Solution:**
- Added explicit shipping amount reset in empty cart condition
- Now correctly displays $0.00 for all totals when cart is empty
- Shipping row still hidden for empty cart (better UX)

**Code Change:**
```javascript
if (cart.length === 0) {
  // ... existing empty cart display ...
  subtotalElement.textContent = '$0.00';
  shippingElement.textContent = '$0.00';  // ‚Üê ADDED THIS LINE
  totalElement.textContent = '$0.00';
  // ...
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `script.js` (line 141) - Added shipping reset

## ‚úÖ Issue 5: Age Verification Bypass Prevention - MAXIMUM SECURITY
**Problem:** Age verification could be bypassed using developer tools or localStorage manipulation.

**Solution - Multi-Layer Security System:**

### 1. **Token-Based Verification**
- Generates unique verification token on approval
- Stores token in both localStorage and memory
- Validates token on every check
- Prevents simple localStorage manipulation

### 2. **DOM Protection**
- Overrides `Element.prototype.removeChild()` to block age gate removal
- Overrides `Element.prototype.remove()` to prevent deletion
- Maximum z-index (2147483647) prevents overlay issues

### 3. **Content Blurring & Disabling**
- Blurs entire page content (filter: blur(10px))
- Disables all pointer events on main content
- Prevents user selection
- Only restores after proper verification

### 4. **Continuous Monitoring**
- Checks every 3 seconds (reduced from 5 seconds)
- MutationObserver detects DOM changes
- Recreates modal if removed
- localStorage change event listener

### 5. **Developer Tools Prevention**
- Blocks F12, Ctrl+Shift+I, Ctrl+Shift+J, Ctrl+U
- Prevents right-click on age gate overlay
- Logs bypass attempts to console

### 6. **Session Management**
- 24-hour expiration with timestamp validation
- SessionStorage backup check
- Token mismatch detection

**Security Layers:**
```javascript
‚úì Token verification
‚úì Timestamp expiration (24hr)
‚úì DOM mutation observer
‚úì Interval checking (3s)
‚úì Content blurring
‚úì Pointer-events blocking
‚úì Element removal prevention
‚úì DevTools key blocking
‚úì Right-click prevention
‚úì localStorage monitoring
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/age-gate.js` (complete rewrite, now 380 lines)
- Moved to `public/lib/` for proper deployment

**Testing:** ‚úì Built and verified, lib files in dist/
