## Setup Steps

### 1. Create a Twilio Account

Twilio is the industry standard for SMS messaging.

1. Go to [twilio.com/try-twilio](https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio)
2. Sign up for a **free trial account**

- About 500 SMS messages (depending on your country)
- No credit card required to start

### 2. Get a Twilio Phone Number

1. Log into your Twilio Console
2. Go to **Phone Numbers** â†’ **Manage** â†’ **Buy a number**
3. Select your country (usually United States)
4. Click **Search** and choose any available number

2. Find your **Account Info** section
3. Copy the following values:
   - **Account SID** (starts with `AC...`)
   - **Auth Token** (click to reveal and copy)

### 4. Configure Supabase Environment Variables

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **Edge Functions** â†’ **Configuration**
3. Add these 4 environment variables:

| Variable Name | Value | Example |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Your Account SID | `ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your Auth Token | `your_auth_token_here` |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` | Your Twilio number | `+15551234567` |
| `ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER` | Your personal phone | `+15559876543` |

**Important Phone Number Format:**
- Must include country code
- Format: `+1` (US) + area code + number
- Example: `+15551234567`
- No spaces, dashes, or parentheses

### 5. Deploy the Edge Function

The Edge Function is already created and ready to deploy.

**Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to **Edge Functions** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Click **Deploy new function**
3. Upload the function from `supabase/functions/order-notification/index.ts`

**Option B: Using Supabase CLI** (if you have it installed)
```bash
supabase functions deploy order-notification
```

## Testing

After deployment:

1. Place a test order on your website
2. Within seconds, you should receive a text message
3. Check that all order details are correct

**Troubleshooting Test Messages:**
- During trial, you can only send to **verified phone numbers**
- Verify your admin phone in Twilio Console: **Phone Numbers** â†’ **Verified Caller IDs**
- Upgrade to a paid account to send to any number (no verification needed)

## Costs

### Trial Account (Free)
- $15.00 in free credits
- Can send ~500 messages
- Only to verified numbers
- Perfect for testing

### Paid Account (After Trial)
- **$1.00/month** - Phone number rental
- **$0.0079/SMS** - US domestic messages (less than 1 cent per text!)
- **$0.040/SMS** - International rates vary

**Example Monthly Cost:**
- 100 orders = $1.79/month
- 500 orders = $4.95/month
- 1000 orders = $8.90/month

## Upgrade to Paid Account

When your trial credits run out or you want to remove restrictions:

1. Go to **Billing** in Twilio Console
2. Click **Upgrade**
3. Add payment method
4. No changes needed to your code

## Benefits of SMS vs Email

âœ… **Instant notifications** - See orders immediately
âœ… **No spam folder** - Always delivered
âœ… **Mobile-friendly** - Perfect for on-the-go
âœ… **Quick glance** - Key info at a glance
âœ… **High open rate** - 98% of SMS messages are read

## Message Customization

You can customize the SMS message in the Edge Function file:
`supabase/functions/order-notification/index.ts` (lines 61-73)

**Character Limit:**
- SMS messages are limited to 160 characters per segment
- Longer messages are automatically split (charged per segment)
- Current message is ~200 characters (2 segments = ~$0.016 per order)

**Customization Ideas:**
- Add emojis for visual cues
- Include direct admin panel link
- Add shipping address details
- Include customer phone number

## Multiple Recipients (Optional)

To send notifications to multiple phone numbers:

1. Add more environment variables in Supabase:
   - `ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER_2`
   - `ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER_3`

2. Update the Edge Function to send multiple messages:
```typescript
const phoneNumbers = [
  ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER,
  Deno.env.get("ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER_2"),
  Deno.env.get("ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER_3")
].filter(Boolean);

for (const phoneNumber of phoneNumbers) {
  // Send SMS to each number
}
```

## Security

- All credentials are stored securely in Supabase environment variables
- Credentials are never exposed to the client
- Only your checkout process can trigger notifications
- Twilio connections use secure HTTPS

## Troubleshooting

### Not Receiving Messages?

1. **Check Phone Number Format**

3. **Trial Account Restrictions**

   - Upgrade to send to any number without verification

4. **Check Twilio Console**

   - See if messages were sent and any error codes
